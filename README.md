# Super Image Quality Enhancer description  
 Developing a deep learning model utilizing residual dense blocks (RDBs) to enhance image quality by focusing on its luminance (Y) component

# Running the Application and Testing the Models
To test the models, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the "Application & GUI" Folder: Open the "App.ipynb" file.
2. Install Necessary Libraries: Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3. Run the Application: Execute the notebook, and a web page will automatically open in your browser.
4. Select Model and Image: Choose the model and image you want to enhance. The enhanced result will appear in the left box.
5. Compare Images: Use the "compare" button to view the original image alongside the enhanced version.


# Creating Your Own Model:
1. Navigate to the "Model Creation Code" Folder: Open the "Model Creator.ipynb" file.
2. Install Necessary Libraries: Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3. Adjust Variables: Modify the following variables as needed:
4. Dataset_location: Specify the location of your dataset.
5. ModelName: Set your preferred model name or use the default.
6. Hyperparameters: Adjust or keep the default values:
      - cropped_width = 600
      - cropped_height = 300
      - batch_size = 32
      - seed = 240
      - validation_split = 0.2
      - upscale_factor = 3
      - epochs_number = 100

> Feel free to experiment with and adjust any settings. The model architecture uses Residual Dense Blocks (RDB), a common structure in image processing models. We used three RDBs and focused on > the Y channel from the YUV color space to reduce the computational power needed for training.
> 
> Please be aware that the model's performance may vary due to our limited resources. It is recommended to create and test your own model within the app for optimal results.
